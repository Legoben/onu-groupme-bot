# Onu: Make money with your Friends

# Why?

The earlier you start investing, the better.

However, millenials are investing [less than previous generations](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-so-few-millennials-invest-in-the-stock-market-2016-7).
So, the question is, how can we make it easier for students to invest?

Onu is a chatbot designed to help people start investing with friends, making it both fun and profitable!

# How does it work?

The highlight of Onu is investing with your friends.
The first thing you do is to set up a _trust_
with your friends. Each person can contribute some money to the trust, which will be
used to make investments.


You can ask Onu about recommendations for which stocks to buy.
Once everyone in the trust agrees to buy a certain stock, Onu will contact a broker
and request a transaction.
